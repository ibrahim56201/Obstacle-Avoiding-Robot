# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot

â€¢	Obstacle Avoiding Robot (Vehicle: Hardware & Software)
Platform: 	 Arduino IDE.
Hardware: 	 Arduino Board, Ultrasonic Sensor

  The project proposes robotic vehicle that has an intelligence built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle comes in its path. This robotic vehicle is built, using a micro-controller. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect any obstacle ahead of it and sends a command to the microcontroller. Depending on the input signal received, the micro-controller redirects the robot to move in an alternate direction by actuating the motors which are interfaced to it through a motor driver.
